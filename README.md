## Overview
With the advancement of AI technologies, distinguishing between real and AI-generated images has become increasingly challenging. This project aims to develop an advanced deepfake detection system by leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques. The system is designed to analyze image data, identify signs of manipulation, and provide a reliable tool for media verification. The development process involves several key stages, including data collection and preprocessing, model development, feature extraction, evaluation, and deployment.

## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

### Stakeholders
- Media and Content Verification Teams: These teams will benefit from improved tools for authenticating images, enhancing the credibility of visual content.
- General Public: Enhanced detection models will help maintain the integrity of visual media, contributing to a more trustworthy information landscape.
- Content Moderation Teams: These teams will implement the detection models to filter and manage visual content, ensuring the authenticity of images shared across platforms.
  
### Business Objectives
- Develop an Accurate Detection Model: Build a machine learning model using advanced deep learning techniques (CNNs, RNNs, and transfer learning) to distinguish between real and manipulated media with high precision.
- Ensure Robust Performance: Train the model on a diverse dataset to ensure consistent performance across various deepfake techniques, adapting to new manipulation methods over time.
- Enhance Usability: Create a user-friendly interface, such as a web application or API, allowing easy verification of media authenticity with clear, actionable feedback for a broad audience.

### Business Problem
Deepfake technology has rapidly advanced, enabling the creation of highly convincing manipulated media that can mislead audiences, spread misinformation, and pose significant threats to personal and organizational security. The challenge lies in developing a sophisticated system capable of detecting these deepfakes and ensuring the authenticity of digital content. This project seeks to address this challenge by creating a comprehensive solution that can accurately identify manipulated media and distinguish it from genuine content.
